# year-progress-cli.py - fork

Same as [SourLemonJuice/year-progress-cli](https://github.com/SourLemonJuice/year-progress-cli) but rewritten with Python.\
I want to use those rewrites to improve my language skills.

The [year-progress.py](./year-progress.py) is the main executable file.

> FORK-UPDATED: We used some _more modern_ and _more compatible_ methods to improve the program
